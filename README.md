# Student-score-prediction
GRIP internship

# Data:-
Dataset comprises of daily study hours of an student and the score the respective student scored in the exams.

# Library Used:-
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Sklearn
6. Scipy

# Objective:
1. To study the dataset.
2. do EDA or feature engineering if neccessary.
3. Built a model to predict score of an student.
4. Predict score for a student who studies for 9.23 hours/day.

# Plots Used:-
1. Boxplot
2. lineplot
3. scatterplot
4. heatmap
5. Q-Q plot

# Inference Drawn:-
Built a model with **RMSE : 4.74**, 

The predicted score for the student that studies for **9.25** hours/day is **92.55 %**
